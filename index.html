  <h3>Thoughts on Web Accessibility</h3>
  <p>In recent years, access to the internet has become a need rather than a want. People use it for communication and 
    work, as well as entertainment. 13% of people have a disability, and the range of severity is extensive; however, we must create accommodations for as many people as possible. We see these accommodations in features 
like voice-to-text, color-blind filters, and many more. Depending on your target audience, you may create
features that prevent the user from getting "lost" on your site. Increased accessibility is excellent for users, but
business owners should also consider accessibility because it helps improve user retention.   </p>

<h3>Progressive Enhancement</h3>
<p>The largest purpose of the internet is to share information. To level the playing field of information. 
  I have taken up to linear algebra in college math classes and I do not think I would have passed without 
  the existence of "YouTube University". Without a solid groundwork of accessibility to the internet such as 
  people with disabilities, regional blocking, or even a lack of access to suitable technology, the vast amount of 
  knowledge on the internet becomes unattainable. This can put many people behind in not just information but 
  in their social class aswell. During covid students without access to the internet are behind 2 whole years of
  education. When building websites perfecting your use of html, css, and javascript will help more people get access 
  to vital internet services.

<h3>DRAGON PROJECT REVISION AND REFLECTION ASSIGNMENT</h3>
<p>After showing my final project to my friends, most of them said that they could not find any faults with it.
  However, they all agreed that it did not feel special or futuristic at all. I do not have the skill quite yet to 
  truly change this, however, I changed the background images to stars rather than just a opaque background. There
  are many different ideas I considered but I deemed them to be a bit out of my skill range. I wanted to make the slick
  demo the background for my header, so that the header image would change. Overall, I am happy with how it turned out.
</p>
<p>
  I believe I did a great job of doing what was expected of me. Most of the assignments were fairly easy to do 
  as we often did nearly an identical project in class. This allowed me to have lots of extra time that I could have
  used more effectively. For example, I could have used the extra time to go above and beyond and have a bit of fun 
  with html, css, and javascript. Near the end of the semester I realized how much potential I was just shy of 
  achieving. If I retook this class I would do more out of class research on how to implement my ideas into my
  web technology projects.

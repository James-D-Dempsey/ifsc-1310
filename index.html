  <h3>Thoughts on Web Accessibility</h3>
  <p>In recent years, access to the internet has become a need rather than a want. People use it for communication and 
    work, as well as entertainment. 13% of people have a disability, the range of severity for is large however it
  is important that we create accommodations for as many people as possible. We see these accomodations in features 
like voice to text, color blind filters, and many more. Depending on your target audience, you may even create
features that prevent the user from getting "lost" on your site. Increased accessibility is great for users, but
buisness owners should also be considerate of accessibility because it helps user rention high.  </p>

  <h3>Thoughts on Web Accessibility</h3>
  <p>In recent years, access to the internet has become a need rather than a want. People use it for communication and 
    work, as well as entertainment. 13% of people have a disability, and the range of severity is extensive; however, we must create accommodations for as many people as possible. We see these accommodations in features 
like voice-to-text, color-blind filters, and many more. Depending on your target audience, you may create
features that prevent the user from getting "lost" on your site. Increased accessibility is excellent for users, but
business owners should also consider accessibility because it helps improve user retention.   </p>

<h3>Progressive Enhancement</h3>
<p>The largest purpose of the internet is to share information. To level the playing field of information. 
  I have taken up to linear algebra in college math classes and I do not think I would have passed without 
  the existence of "YouTube University". Without a solid groundwork of accessibility to the internet such as 
  people with disabilities, regional blocking, or even a lack of access to suitable technology, the vast amount of 
  knowledge on the internet becomes unattainable. This can put many people behind in not just information but 
  in their social class aswell. During covid students without access to the internet are behind 2 whole years of
  education. When building websites perfecting your use of html, css, and javascript will help more people get access 
  to vital internet services.
